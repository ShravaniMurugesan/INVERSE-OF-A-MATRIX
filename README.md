# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1:Import numpy to perform the inverse of matrix operation
### Step 2:Create the matrix to find the inverse,representing as a Numpy array 
### Step 3: Use the numpy. linalg.det() function to ensure the determination of matrix is non-singular matrix have inverses
### Step 4:End the program 

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by:shravani.m
#RegisterNumber:24006268
import numpy as np
matrix=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
inverse=np.linalg.inv(matrix)
print(inverse)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
